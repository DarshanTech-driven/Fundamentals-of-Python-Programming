## Features

- View all your expenses in a clean, formatted way.
- Set a monthly budget and receive warnings if your expenses exceed your set limit.

- No automatic charts or analytics are currently available.
- Can be enhanced with features like category filtering, analysis, multi-user support, or a web/mobile UI.

## Summary
